# HR Analytics Dashboard â€“ Tableau Project

![Dashboard Preview](Dashboard_Screenshot.png)

Welcome to my HR Analytics Dashboard project, built using Tableau and a cleaned HR dataset. This interactive visualization provides meaningful insights into employee attrition, income trends, and department performance to help organizations make informed HR decisions.

---

## Project Overview

This project explores:

- Key HR metrics like attrition rate, employee count, and monthly income
- Demographic breakdowns by gender and age
- Job role and department-wise performance insights
- **Forecasting** to support **predictive analysis** on attrition trends

The dashboard uses a bold **black-and-yellow** highlight color scheme to draw attention to KPIs and forecast indicators.

## Forecasting & Predictive Analysis

The dashboard includes forecasting models built with Tableauâ€™s native forecasting (exponential smoothing):

- Visualize **monthly attrition rate projections**
- Anticipate **future spikes or drops** in attrition
- Align HR strategies with **data-driven insights**
- This adds a **predictive layer** to traditional analytics, helping organizations proactively address workforce challenges.

## How to Open the Project

1. Download and install **Tableau Desktop** or **Tableau Public**
2. Open the `HR_Analytics_Dashboard.twbx` file
3. Make sure all three Excel files are in the **same directory** as the workbook:
   - `HR_Data_Cleaned_Table_1.xlsx`
   - `HR_Data_Cleaned_Table_2.xlsx`
   - `HR_Data_Cleaned_Table_3.xlsx`
4. Tableau will automatically join them as per the original schema
5. Interact with filters (e.g., Gender, Age Distribution)
6. Review the forecasting graph under **Attrition Rate Over Time**

## Key Insights

âœ… 16% Attrition Rate  
âœ… Highest attrition in Sales department  
âœ… R&D has the highest employee count but lower attrition  
âœ… Forecast predicts a spike in attrition by 2024  
âœ… Males represent 60%+ of the workforce  
âœ… Managers earn the highest income across job roles  
âœ… Age and income patterns reveal strategic talent gaps

## Key Recommendations

1. **Strengthen Retention in Sales**  
   - Sales shows the highest attrition rate (21%). Offer exit interviews, retention bonuses, and flexible schedules.

2. **Monitor Forecasted Attrition**  
   - Attrition is expected to spike in 2024. Begin succession planning and manager training now.

3. **Improve Gender Balance**  
   - Gender distribution skews male. Promote inclusive hiring practices.

4. **Focus on Mid-Age Talent**  
   - Invest in career development for employees aged 25â€“44.

5. **Optimize High-Income Roles**  
   - Ensure productivity of high-income roles like Managers and Directors.

6. **Leverage Departmental Strengths**  
   - Use R&D as a model department for best practices.
